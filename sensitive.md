# Securely Managing and Publishing Sensitive Data

Are you working with environmental, commercial, health, personal, or other sensitive data? Are you unsure whether your data is sensitive and unclear on your responsibilities for managing it?

In this workshop, we will discuss the foundations of working with sensitive data including how to protect your data, your research participants, and yourself. We'll take about how and when to de-identify sensitive data, and how to share sensitive data.

Presentation by Isaac Pratt, Research Data Management Specialist.
