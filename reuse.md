# Before You Dig: Finding and Reusing Datasets

<img alt="DOI and ORCiD webinar advert graphic" style="border-width:0" src="https://github.com/scds/intro-rdm/raw/main/assets/img/reuse.png">

Are you starting a research project? There may be existing datasets that could inform the work you're doing and ensure you're digging into new research areas. Along with systematic literature review and active participation in your field, a dataset search is another tool to inform your research context.

Join McMaster RDM Services to learn more about finding and reusing datasets in data repositories across the world. Find potential new collaborators, verify or reproduce results, expand on existing data, and more!

Presented by RDM Specialists Danica Evering, MA and Isaac Pratt, PhD.
