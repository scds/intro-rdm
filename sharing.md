# Essentials of open data sharing.

Join the open data movement! Are you thinking about sharing your data? Have you been told by a journal or funder that you need to publish your data online? In this session, we will go over the benefits (and potential risks) of data sharing, and highlight some of the different data repository options available to you as a researcher.

This webinar is scheduled for July 8th, 2021 and is not yet available. To sign up for the live presentation, please visit [our event registration page here.](https://libcal.mcmaster.ca/calendar/library/data-sharing)
