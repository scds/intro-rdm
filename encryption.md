# How to Implement Encryption to Protect your Research Data Online

The modern online environment is dangerous - data breaches and cyber attacks are increasingly prevalent, making safeguarding sensitive research data more important than ever. Join Isaac Pratt (Research Data Management Specialist) for this workshop diving into the world of encryption.

No technical expertise required – we’ll demystify encryption and show you how it can be used to secure your data against unauthorized access, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

During this interactive session, you will:

* Gain a clear understanding of the language of encryption: Learn what encryption is, how it works, and why it's crucial for protecting your research data.
* Empower yourself with practical knowledge: Explore a range of digital tools and discover how to easily encrypt files, drives, and folders.
* Unlock the power of Veracrypt: watch a demo of Veracrypt, a free open-source encryption tool that you can start using right away.
