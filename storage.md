# Strategies for research data storage and backup.

Looking for a better way to store your data? Not sure what the difference is between Dropbox or OneDrive? Join us for a session on research data storage and backup. In this workshop, we will go over the different storage platforms available to you as a researcher, their features and drawbacks, and when to choose a particular platform. We will also consider some data backup and security principles and touch on the basics of storing and encrypting sensitive research data.

Presentation by Isaac Pratt, Research Data Management Specialist.
