# Strategies for research data storage and backup.

Looking for a better way to store your data? Not sure what the difference is between Dropbox or OneDrive? Join us for a session on research data storage and backup. In this workshop, we will go over the different storage platforms available to you as a researcher, their features and drawbacks, and when to choose a particular platform. We will also consider some data backup and security principles and touch on the basics of storing and encrypting sensitive research data.
