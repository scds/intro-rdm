# Building a Data Management Plan for your research project.

Planning ahead for research helps you prepare for data questions and problems before they happen. Submitting a Data Management Plan (DMP) is increasingly a requirement for funding applications with Tri-Agencies and the NIH. But DMPs can also be very helpful "living documents": research tools that identify strengths and gaps which are updated through your research process. In this session, we'll start with best practices of data management planning and go through a demo of DMP Assistant, a web-based tool for developing and collaborating on Data Management Plans in the Canadian research context.

Presentation by Danica Evering and Emilie Altman, Research Data Management Specialists.
