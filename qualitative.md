# Qualitative Data - Practices for RDM Planning and Sharing

<img alt="Qualitative Data webinar advert graphic" style="border-width:0" src="https://github.com/scds/intro-rdm/raw/main/assets/img/qualitative.png">

Qualitative methods let us share nuanced interpretations of multifaceted issues. They let us understand lived experiences and motivations, see a research question from different standpoints, and highlight contexts. Qualitative research data can take the form of interview transcripts, oral histories, focus groups, field notes, audio, video, and more. Some qualitative researchers are accustomed to research data management (RDM) and data sharing, while others are less familiar.

This workshop welcomes both groups to learn about best practices and considerations for managing and sharing quantitative data. We’ll start with practical skills and workflows, and then move on to a discussion about hesitations and urgencies. Qualitative research often grows out of relationships of trust, and information is deeply contextual, making data sharing sticky. However, communities are often approached by different researchers for similar information, and data sharing can also help alleviate research fatigue. Let’s learn and unpack together!
